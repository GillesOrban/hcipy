# Caution:

This library is still under heavy development. Many functions are untested and may not work as expected. Testing and adding functionality will continue over the next few weeks.

# Installation
Installing is as any Python module:

python setup.py install

If you want to make changes in the code itself, do:

python setup.py install --develop

This will create a symbolic link from the python packages to the current directory, so that any changes in this directory are directly available to python without reinstalling the package itself.
